# Numismacraft

Numismacraft is a mod for coin collecting in Minecraft made by Eman7blue. It is a tech mod (meme).

Currently only pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters between 1909-2022 exist. More coins will be coming. Only US coins will be implemented for now, with UK and Euro coins being planned for the future.
